Module that contains the command line app.

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in __main__?

  You might be tempted to import things from __main__ later, but that will cause
  problems: the code will get executed twice:

  - When you run `python -mciftostr` python will execute
    ``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
    ``ciftostr.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
  - When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
    there's no ``ciftostr.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.

    This program converts an arbitrary number of CIFs, each containing an arbitrary number of
    structures, into a number of individual STR files that are compatible with TOPAS.

    Choose the files you want to convert using the 'Browse' button, then click 'Convert' to convert them.

    If you would like to run it in the command line, you need to provide some command line arguments:
    >ciftostr *.cif
    or you can type the individual names of CIFs to use after the pyz file.

    The program can also run in jEdit mode.
    > ciftostr --jedit *.cif output.str
    In this mode, all structures in all cifs are written to a single file. This can be used by the
    jEdit macros to import a structure from a CIF into jEdit, when writing INP files.

    This program is designed to reformat data from a CIF format into the STR format suitable
    for use by the Rietveld analysis software, TOPAS. It doesn't carry out any validation checks
    to ensure the data is consistent, but simply transcribes the data as given in the CIF.

    Where similar or identical data could be given in several places, the values are taken in a
    specific order of precedence, as detailed in the sections below. In general, if a value exists
    in an earlier place, the later places are not looked at.

    This program uses the PyCifRW library, written by James Hester, to parse the CIF files into
    a format easily used to remix the underlying data. For the source code and other information,
    see https://bitbucket.org/jamesrhester/pycifrw/src/development. The GUI was created using PySimpleGUI.

    The STR's phase_name is taken from '_chemical_name_mineral', '_chemical_name_common',
    '_chemical_name_systematic', or '_chemical_name_structure_type', in that order, appended with
    the value of the 'data' block. If none of these keys are available, then the name of the 'data_'
    block is used. This is also used as the filename of the STR file.

    The unit cell parameters are taken from '_cell_length_a', '_cell_length_b', '_cell_length_c',
    '_cell_angle_alpha', '_cell_angle_beta', and '_cell_angle_gamma'. Some comparisons are made to
    enable some standard macros to be used (eg Cubic, Tetragonal...). In any of these fail, then all
    parameters are given as a fail safe.

    The space_group is taken from '_symmetry_space_group_name_H-M', '_space_group_name_H-M_alt',
    '_symmetry_Int_Tables_number', or '_space_group_IT_number', in that order. If none of these keys
    are available, then an empty string is written as the space group. The value of the space group is
    as exactly given in the CIF. No validation or editing is done.

    The atomic sites are constructed as follows: The atom labels are taken from '_atom_site_label',
    with the fractional x, y, and z coordinates given by '_atom_site_fract_x', '_y', and '_z'.
    If the decimal values of the fractional coordinates are consistent with the fractions 1/6, 1/3, 2/3,
    or 5/6, then the decimal value is replaced by the fractions.

    The site occupancy is given by '_atom_site_occupancy', or by '1', if that key is not given.
    The atom type is given by '_atom_site_type_symbol', where available, or by the first one or two
    characters of the site label. If these characters match an element symbol, then that is used,
    otherwise, the label is used in it's entirety, and the user must decide the correct atom type to use.
    If the site label starts with 'Wat', then it is assumed that this means 'water', and an oxygen atom
    is used. An attempt is also made to reorder the charge given on an atom, to ensure it is compatible with
    TOPAS ordering, eg Fe+2, not Fe2+.

    Isotropic Atomic Displacement Parameters (ADPs; Biso), are taken from '_atom_site_B_iso_or_equiv', or
    from '_atom_site_U_iso_or_equiv', where they are then multiplied by 8*Pi^2 to give B values.
    If anisotropic ADPs are given, then '_atom_site_aniso_B_11', '_atom_site_aniso_B_22', and
    '_atom_site_aniso_B_33' are averaged to give an equivalent Biso value. Alternatively, the equivalent
    U values are used to calculate Biso. As anisotropic values could be given for a subset of the atoms
    in the structure, the labels given by '_atom_site_label' and '_atom_site_aniso_label' are matched,
    and if an atom doesn't have an anisotropic value, it takes its isotropic value, or is assigned a
    value of '1'.

    The atomic site is also given a 'num_posns 0' entry, which will update with the multiplicity of the
    site following a refinement. This will allow the user to compare this value with the CIF or Vol A
    to help ensure that the correct symmetry is being applied.

    Finally, the STR is given a fixed Lorentzian crystallite size of 200 nm, and a refinable scale factor
    of 0.0001 to allow for an easy start to a refinement. All other values given in the STR are fixed,
    and require active intervention to name, refine, constrain, or restrain them.

    If you have any feedback, please contact me. If you find any bugs, please provide the CIF which
    caused the error, a description of the error, and a description of how you believe the program
    should work in that instance.

    Thanks, Matthew Rowles.
